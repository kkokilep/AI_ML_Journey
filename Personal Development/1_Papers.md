#### Paper Notes: 

* "If you make it your mindset, your vision of who you are, that you're going to make it a habit to give 100%, 100% of the time
, in everything you do - if you make it your norm, your base level, your default mode - then even on your absolutely worse day,
even when you slip, you're still going to be better than the average person on their best day."
