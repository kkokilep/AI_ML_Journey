### Topic: Recursion
#### Notes: 

* One-Branch Recursion
* 5! = 5 * 4!
* n! = n * (n-1)!
* Use Decision Tree to visualize
* Need to set the base case correctly
* Each function takes up memory on the call stack

```aiignore
def factorial(n):
    if(n<=1):
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)
```

* 2 Branch Recursion
* Fibonacci Example
* F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
* F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
* Idea is that every call has a return statement that sits on the call stack waiting for a return of a base case value
* Number of layers is n
* Number of values in last level is 2^n
* Can bound with upper bound 2^(n+1)
```aiignore
def fib(n):
    if(n<=1):
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

```
