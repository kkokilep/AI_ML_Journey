### Topic: Search Array
#### Notes: 

* Run on sorted arrays
* Two pointers control the boundaries 
* Left and Right Pointer
* (L+R) / 2 = the approximate middle index
* Time complexity is O(log(n))
```aiignore
def binary_search(arr,target):
    L,R = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while L <=R:
        mid = (L + R)//2
        if(target>arr[mid]):
            L = mid + 1
        elif(target<arr[mid]):
            R = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
