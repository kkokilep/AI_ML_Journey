### Topic: Singly Linked Lists
#### Notes: 

* Made of List Nodes
  * Have a value and a pointer called next.
* Connection of ListNodes together is called a LinkedList
* ListNode is somewhere in memory
* next pointer is a reference to another pointer
  * ListNode1.next = ListNode2
  * Reference to object is enough
  * Memory of nodes can be at random locations, but they are all connected via pointers.

```
# Iterate through a Linked List
cur = ListNode1
while(cur!=Null):
    cur=cur.next
```
* O(n) to iterate through list where n is the size of the list
* Good to keep track to head and tail of the List.
```aiignore
# Update the last element of the list
tail.next = ListNode4
tail = ListNode4
```
* O(1) operation to add to end of list
```aiignore
# remove node from the list
head.next = head.next.next
```
* O(1) operation for removal

### Topic: Doubly Linked Lists
#### Notes: 

* Have both a previous pointer and a next pointer
```aiignore
# Add new element to doubly linked list
tail.next = ListNode4
ListNode4.prev = tail
tail = tail.next
```
```aiignore
# Remove from doubly linked list
node2 = tail.prev
node2.next = null
tail = node2
```
* Can't arbitrarily access elements in Linked Lists
  * O(n) used to access elements
* Insert/Remove from middle is O(1)
  * Removing an element involves just moving the pointer to the next element
  * Need to arrive at the element before we can remove

### Topic: Queues
#### Notes: 

* FIFO - First In First Out
* Enqueue =  Push to the end
* Dequeue = Remove from the front
* Do both operations O(1)
* Can implement with Linked List
