### Topic: Heap Properties
#### Notes: 

* Order a queue based on a priority
* Min / Max Priority
* Priority Queue implemented with a Binary Heap
* Min Heap more common

* Structure Property = Complete Binary Tree
  * Tree where every single level is completely full except for the last level
  * Need to add nodes from left to right
* Order Property = Want to find the minimum or maximum value really quickly
  * Recursively all values should be greater than or equal to the root for the total tree and all subtrees
  * Can have duplicates
* Want minimum or maximum at the root
* Implemented as arrays
  * Put root at index 1
  * Due to structure we can access all the children directly in an array
  * leftChild = 2*i
  * rightChild = 2*i+1
  * parent = i/2
  * Not true for a regular binary tree

### Topic: Heap Push and Pop
#### Notes:

* Add in an element as the child
* Swap the parent and child if the heap property isn't statisfied
* Since the parent was originally valid, there is no need to check the subtree connected on the other side


```aiignore
class Heap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = [0]
    def push(self,val):
        self.heap.append(val)
        i = len(self.heap)-1
        while(self.heap[i] < self.heap[i//2]):
            tmp = self.heap[i]
            self.heap[i] = self.heap[i//2]
            self.heap[i//2] = tmp
            i = i // 2
```

* Insertion is O(log(n))

* Pop involves removing the root and replacing it with the last element in the heap
