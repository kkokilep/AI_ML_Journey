### Topic: Bit Manipulation
#### Notes: 

* n = 1 & 1 AND
* n = 1 | 0 OR
* n = 0 ^ 1 XOR
* n = ~n Negation

* n = 1 
* n = n << 1 Bit Shifting means shift all bits to left or right and replace with 0 at the introduced spot
* n = n >> 1

```aiignore
def CountBits(n):
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        if n & 1 == 1:
            count +=1
        n = n >> 1
    return count
```
