### Topic: Trie
#### Notes: 

* Also called a Prefix Tree
* Insert word in constant time
* Search word in constant time
* Search prefix in constant time
* Trie is a tree of characters
* Only need to worry about lower case characters
* Every character has 26 children to represent all the other children
```aiignore
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.word = False
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    def insert(self,word):
        curr = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in curr.children:
                curr.children[c] = TrieNode()
            curr = curr.children[c]
        curr.word = True
        
    def search(self, word):
        curr = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in curr.children:
                return False
            curr = curr.children[c]
        return curr.word
    
    def startsWith(self, prefix):
        curr = self.root
        for c in prefix:
            if c not in curr.children:
                return False
            curr = curr.children[c]
        return True
```
* Insert means iterate through every character and add it as a TrieNode
* Search means iterate through all the characters in the trie
* Don't want redundant characters
* Can get a prefix
