### Topic: Insertion Sort
#### Notes: 

* Sort values one by one until you have the entire array sorted
* Should not move to the next element until you know that the subarray is sorted.
  * Don't need to compare with all elements of the array because we know that the previous sub array is sorted
* If you arrive at a value that is bigger than last element of previous sub array, then continually swap until you reach an element that you are larger than.
* Need check in bounds first before making comparison to avoid out of bounds error.

```aiignore
for i in range(1,len(arr)):
    j=i-1
    while(j>=0 and arr[j+1] < arr[j]):
        tmp = arr[j+1]
        arr[j+1] = arr[j]
        arr[j] = tmp
        j = j - 1
```

* Stable vs. Unstable Sorting algorithm
  * Preserves the relative sorting of elements
